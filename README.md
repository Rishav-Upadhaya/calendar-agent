Agent_Share automates the addition of IPO events to your Google Calendar, including reminders for each event.

## Features

- Automatically adds IPO events to your calendar.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) (for dependency and environment management)
- Google account (for calendar integration)
- Google Calendar API credentials (see below)

## Obtaining Google API Credentials & Generating Token

1. **Get Google Calendar API credentials:**
   - Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
   - Create a new project or select an existing one.
   - Navigate to **APIs & Services > Library** and enable the **Google Calendar API**.
   - Go to **APIs & Services > Credentials**.
   - Click **Create Credentials** > **OAuth client ID**.
   - Choose **Desktop app** as the application type.
   - Download the `credentials.json` file and place it in your project directory.

2. **Generate the token:**
   - Run the following command to execute `generate_token.py`:
     ```bash
     uv run src/generate_token.py
     ```
   - Follow the authentication flow in your browser. After successful authentication, a `token.json` file will be created in your project directory.

3. **Proceed to run the main application as described above.**
